Finding new oscillators and spaceships is very hard using this algorithm since most often it doesnt converge towards a stable pattern that
is the same as the starting pattern. One thing that was tried to combat this is to change the intial starting state to the state at which
the check function returns true. this unfortunatelly didnt work very well either but let us see that when you initialize a glider the function
returns true after every 4th generation except for when PBC comes into play.

The better approach would be to first let the game run for a few generations hopefully stabalizing and first then compare generation 
to generation. This would work better but still most likely converges to already known patterns. In conclusion it would take some
more modification for it to be precise.
