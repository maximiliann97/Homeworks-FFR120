a.

The evolution spreads out over the grid with pathways. The systems evolves towards the outer rim and then becomes
stable in some generation over 20. The system evolves towards overpopulation rather than extinction.

c.
It is likely that a random set of rules results in complexity is rather high since the game of life is model that makes it easier to understand the universe. 
It is a simple example of how huge complexity can be derived from very simple rules.The rules can be simple enough for one person to understand, 
and yet produce a universe so complex that that it takes the the entire human race to understand just part of it.

This also corresponds well with the findings of playing around with some different rules, you often end up with complex states rather than total extinction
