a.

The evolution spreads out over the grid with pathways. The systems evolves towards the outer rim and then becomes
stable in some generation over 20. The system evolves towards overpopulation rather than extinction.

c.
Extinction rules are pretty hard to find while stability is pretty easy. At least if you are looking for non-trivial solutions.
