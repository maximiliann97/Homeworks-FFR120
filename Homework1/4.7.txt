a.

The evolution spreads out over the grid with pathways. The systems evolves towards the outer rim and then becomes
stable in some generation over 20. The system evolves towards overpopulation rather than extinction.

c.
Extinction rules are pretty hard to find while stability is pretty easy. At least if you are looking for non-trivial solutions.
If you are randomizing the rules it would pretty likely that you end up with overpopulation and a stable state. This is at least
true for a random distribution with 50% alive and 50% dead either in the center of a larger grid or covering a complete grid.
This is what is found both from own code and using some example program online.
